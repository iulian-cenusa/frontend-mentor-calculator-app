## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was fun to complete. It taught me a lot about how to create themes on web pages and also I gain experience on backend ( javaScript ) by doing all the logic behind. Also I learn to use local storage feature of browsers in order to store the prefered theme and on page refresh it should remain selected.

### Continued development

This project is 99.99% complete. Though it can be improved on backend ( calculator operations or complex operations ) and frontend ( more accurate to design files ).

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Css Generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - This helped me with generating the correct box shadow for calculator keypad.
- [Storage - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) - This helped me understanding local storage feature of browsers and how to use it in JS.
